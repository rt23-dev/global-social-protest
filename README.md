GSP is a database on global social protest from 1851-2023 created by the Global Social Protest Research Working Group at the Arrighi Center for Global Studies (Johns Hopkins University). I contest that their methods are outdated, and a larger, more robust database can be created and analyzed by leveraging LLMs.
